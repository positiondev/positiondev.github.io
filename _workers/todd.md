Todd is a developer with 8 years' experience writing software with Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP. Recent career highlights include implementing TypeScript analysis for Code Climate and building Etsy's new order management app with React and Redux.

What makes him unique, though, is his prior background as an technical support agent and tester. He's acutely aware that solid technology is not the only factor in a project’s success—close collaboration and effective communication are also vital.
