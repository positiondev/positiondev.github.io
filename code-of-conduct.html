      <p>If you are being harassed by a member or guest of
Position Development, notice that someone else is being harassed, or
have any other concerns, please contact Position at
workers@positiondev.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the
team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will
        respond as promptly as we can.</p>
      <p>This code of conduct applies to
Position Development spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member
or guest of Position Development outside our spaces, we still want to
know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by
Position Development members or guests seriously. This includes harassment
outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in
time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from
Position Development events based on their past behavior, including
behavior outside Position Development spaces and behavior towards
        people who are not in Position Development.</p>
      <p>In order to protect
response team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject
any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended
        to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.  </p>
      <p>Wewill respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person
about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn
third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase
the safety of Position Development guests, members, or the general
public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative
consent.</p>
