Jeca loves writing software that solves people's problems, and is grateful to have had the opportunity to do just that as a consultant on over a dozen projects.

In her free time she is on the board of a national nonprofit advancing the careers of women and nonbinary people in tech and organizes their NYC chapter, and in a past life she worked in fundraising and community organizing around environmental, labor, and social issues.
