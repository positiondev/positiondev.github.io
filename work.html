    <p>We're a software development company that serves leftist and
      independent media companies. We're dedicated to building quality
      software to help expand the breadth of discourse, culture, and thought
      available to English-speaking audiences. We also look for
      opportunities to grow our collective skill sets for unique and
      creative projects.</p>

    <p>We're equally dedicated providing a healthy working environment. We
      believe that developers do their best work when they have plenty of
      time off, and we encourage everyone to work about 30-35 hours per
      week. We like what we do, but we recognize that it is work, not

        of love</a>.</p>
