    <p>We're a software development company that serves leftist and
      independent media companies. We're dedicated to building quality
      software to help expand the breadth of discourse, culture, and thought

    <p>We're equally dedicated providing a healthy working environment. We
      believe that developers do their best work when they have plenty of
      time off, and we encourage everyone to work about 30-35 hours per
      week. We like what we do, but we recognize that it is work, not

    users, and work with experienced developers to build features that bring value to our clients.</p>

  <h4>We’re looking for someone who can:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and style web pages with HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>Use Vue, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages</li>
    <li>Create forms that communicate with a backend</li>

  </ul>
</section>

  <p>We’re looking for a developer with at least 3 years of
    experience to join our team onsite in Brooklyn.</p>

  <h4>Ruby on Rails Developer</h4>

  <p>You'll be working mainly on our <strong>largest and most successful project</strong>,
      Folio. This Rails application has enabled Verso Books to sell books
      directly to customers over the past five years, and now it’s the
      platform that Haymarket Books and Seven Stories Press use as well.</p>

  <p>We collaborate closely with our clients to make Folio better and
    you would have an important role in making that happen. Direct sales
    through Folio provide a crucial revenue stream for independent
    publishers. By working on Folio, you'll have <strong>daily real-world impact</strong> helping
    them grow and reach new readers.</p>

  <h4>Polyglot Web Developer</h4>

  <p> Depending on your skills and preferences as well as client demand,
      you’ll work on projects from several different clients: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Wayland magazine platform</strong> used by Jacobin,
      Current Affairs, and Dissent. Position maintains several Haskell
      libraries, including a web framework, developed for Wayland.</li>
    <li>An <strong>experimental book search product</strong> built in
      collaboration with book publisher clients. It's built using Java 8,
    Solr, and React. We can’t tell you too much about it yet, but it’s
    very exciting.</li>
    <li>A <strong>custom CRM</strong> for a magazine, written in Python and VueJS</li>
    <li>The Ruby on Rails publishing platform, Folio, described above</li>
    <li>Several other projects in our pipeline, which include data
    migrations, interactive maps, and data visualizations for progressive
    blogs, radical history teachers, and machine learning startups,
    written in Python, React, and/or VueJS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While <strong>we work in many different languages</strong>, our
    infrastructure is standardized around Docker and Amazon Web Services.</p>

  <h3>What are typical days at Position like?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Monday through Thursday, we write code for clients:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using test-driven development, you'll <strong>build new features</strong> for web applications.</li>
      <li>We'll review your code, and you'll review our code and give helpful advice.</li>
      <li>You'll <strong>pair program</strong> with other developers about half the time.</li>
      <li>You'll improve the codebases through <strong>refactoring</strong>.</li>
      <li>You'll write unit and integration <strong>tests</strong>.</li>
      <li>You'll use git for version control.</li>
      <li>You'll <strong>debug problems</strong> found by clients and their customers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On Fridays, we do most of the non-client work that keeps Position
      running, including meetings, planning, sales, hiring, and other
      essential functions. We also take this time to improve processes and
      learn new things.</p>

  <h3>Benefits</h3>

  <div class="nine columns">
    <ul class="outside">
      <li> 30-35 hour work week</li>
      <li>Flextime: core hours are 10:30am - 3pm</li>
      <li>5 weeks of paid vacation and 10 paid holidays per year</li>
      <li>New computer for work</li>
      <li>Commuter benefits</li>
      <li>Paid family leave</li>
      <li>Health insurance with significant premium subsidy</li>
      <li>Discretionary funds for conferences, events, and sponsorships</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <h3>Our hiring process</h3>

  <div>
    <p>We <strong>collect demographic information</strong> to better
    understand our applicant outreach. This information is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>optional</li>
      <li>anonymous, and</li>
      <li><strong>not attached to your application</strong> in any way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We’ll use <strong>aggregate</strong> data during the resume review
    stage to learn if we need to do more outreach, and in the future to
    determine if our outreach efforts are improving each year.</p>

    <p>We do <strong>blind resume review</strong> to counter unconscious
    bias. This means a friend of Position will blank out your name and any
    social media handles or personal website URLs before we review your
    resume. Importantly, <strong>we don’t review your website or Github</strong>
    as part of the resume review step. So, if there’s something on your
    Github or website you’d like us to know about, please talk about it in
    your cover letter or resume.</p>

    <p>We use <strong>structured interviewing</strong>. This means that we
      ask every applicant the same basic questions.</p>

    <p>We <strong>value diversity</strong> and encourage applications from
      members of groups underrepresented in tech. We do not discriminate on
      the basis of age, color, creed, disability, gender identity or
      expression, gender, genetics, marital status, military status,
      national origin or ancestry, race, religion, or sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>We provide reasonable accommodations as needed to people with disabilities.</p>

    <p>After we receive your resume, we’ll email you with more detailed
      information about our process. <strong>If you have any questions</strong>,
    drop us a line at <a href="mailto:work@positiondev.com">work@positiondev.com</a>
      and we'll be happy to answer or schedule a call.</p>
